Marking a logged-in user as a spammer in BuddyPress doesn't do anything until that user is logged out.  Until now!

== Description ==

In BuddyPress, when an admin marks a live user as a spammer, that user can still surf around and cause havoc on the site until they are logged out. This plugin stops live spammers in their tracks!

This is a temporary plugin to address [bug #4814](https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4814).

An alternative without using this plugin is to simply delete the user from your site.

== Installation ==

1. Requires BuddyPress
1. Download, install and activate this plugin.
